## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a working Rock, Paper, Scissors game in JavaScript from scratch. 

## Skill to be demonstrated
- JavaScript
- Conditional Logic
- JavaScript functions

## Tools used
- VSCode
- Live Server
- Git / GitHub

## To do 
- [X] Start a new GitHub Repo
- [ ] Clone repo - set git user for repo to personal, not school
- [ ] Create a blank HTML document with a script link
- [ ] Set repo to display a live preview
- [ ] Write a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 
- [ ] Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
- [ ] Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).
- [ ] Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
- [ ] Setup a loop to play 5 rounds
- [ ] At this point you should be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.
- [ ] Use prompt() to get input from the user. Read the docs here if you need to.
